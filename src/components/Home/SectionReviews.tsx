    text: "I couldn’t be happier with my experience working with Grand Pools! From start to finish, the team was incredibly professional, attentive, and committed to delivering exactly what I envisioned.\n\nWe recently built our dream home in Toorak, and adding a pool was a key part of the project. The Grand Pools team guided me through the entire process, from design to installation, ensuring every detail aligned with the style of our property. I was especially impressed by their creative ideas; they incorporated a stunning infinity edge and elegant mosaic tiling that became the centerpiece of our outdoor space.\n\nThe craftsmanship is outstanding, and the pool has truly elevated the look and feel of our home. It's now our favorite place to relax and entertain, and our guests are constantly amazed by how it looks. Thank you, Grand Pools, for your incredible work. I would highly recommend you to anyone looking to enhance their home with a beautiful, custom pool!",

    text: "Our dream pool was designed, built and delivered by the expert team at Grand Pools just in time for the kids' best Christmas ever! Working with tricky access, awkward angles, close to boundaries and housing foundations this was not an easy build, however, nothing was too much trouble for Lachlan and the entire team. From start to finish we were kept updated, the transition between trades was seamless and the result is the talk of our street!\n\nThe waterfall from spa to pool provides a tranquility all year round, the spa is enjoyed on cold winter days, some have even braved the health benefits of the hot/cold dips. Our family loves what this has created for our lifestyle. The attention to detail and high standard of craftsmanship are evident in every aspect of the pool, even in the filter and pump set up! Lachlan thinks of everything! We could not recommend Grand Pools enough.",
